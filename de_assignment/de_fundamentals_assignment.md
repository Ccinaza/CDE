# End-to-End Data Pipeline Design for Customer Complaint Analytics

## Overview
Today at **Beejan Technologies**, customer interaction data is scattered across multiple systems like call-centre log files, website forms, social media, and SMS. Each department consumes this data differently, leading to duplication, delays, and blind spots during customer surges. To solve this problem, I am proposing this conceptual this pipeline that integrates diverse sources with batch and streaming capabilities, delivering near-real-time insights while ensuring compliance and scalability.

This pipeline will:
- Integrate multiple data sources (calls, SMS, WhatsApp, surveys, social platforms).  
- Provide both batch and streaming capabilities for flexible data handling.  
- Enable faster, more accurate insights into customer behaviour and surge patterns.  
- Support compliance, scalability, and cross-department collaboration.  

**Result**: A system where decision-makers can anticipate surges, reduce duplication, and act proactively instead of reactively.

## Assumptions
- Moderate real-time needs (hourly, not sub-second) for social/SMS.  
- Customer IDs are linkable where explicit (e.g forms/logs), but social data is often anonymous.  
- Volumes grow moderately; spikes occur during outages. Management requires near-real-time visibility (hours, not days).  
- PII exists in some channels (e.g call centre, forms, SMS), while social media contains mostly public identifiers. Regulatory compliance is critical but undefined.  
- End users include Reporting/Analytics, Customer Experience (CX), Network Operations, and Data Science.  

---

## 1. Source Identification
**Design**:  
Sources include social media (unstructured posts), call centre logs (semi-structured exports), SMS (unstructured messages), and website forms (structured fields like customer ID, complaint).  
- Social/SMS arrive continuously (streaming-compatible).  
- Logs/forms are periodic (batch-suited), with thousands daily and outage-driven spikes.  

**Rationale**:  
A hybrid approach—streaming for social/SMS, batch for logs/forms—balances immediacy for urgent issues (e.g., viral complaints) with efficiency for stable data. This addresses delayed reporting by enabling near-real-time insights alongside trend analysis, aligning with management’s need for faster visibility.

## 2. Ingestion Strategy
**Design**:  
- Streaming ingestion for social media/SMS via continuous event capture (e.g., message queues).  
- Batch ingestion for logs/forms via scheduled transfers.  
- Raw data lands as-is (ELT) in a time-partitioned raw zone.  

**Rationale**:  
Source-tailored ingestion matches data dynamics—streaming reduces time-to-insight for volatile channels, while batch minimises complexity for periodic data. ELT preserves raw data for future reprocessing, chosen for flexibility given evolving analytics needs and to prevent premature data loss, ensuring auditability and scalability.

## 3. Processing & Transformation
**Design**:  
- Standardise formats (e.g., dates, text case).  
- Deduplicate (content-based).  
- Handle missing values (flag/impute).  
- Enrich by classifying complaints into categories (e.g., network, billing, service) via rule-based keyword/pattern matching.  
- Add metadata (e.g., sentiment, geolocation, where available).  
- Unified schema includes: complaint ID, source, customer identifier (where applicable), timestamp, category, and severity.  

**Rationale**:  
Standardisation ensures cross-channel consistency, breaking silos for unified analysis. Rule-based classification is simple, auditable, and business-aligned, chosen for initial clarity while allowing future refinement. Enrichment (e.g., sentiment for prioritisation) drives actionable insights. ELT-based processing post-load supports iterative improvements, assuming variable data quality.  

---

## 4. Storage Architecture
**Design**:  
- Raw data lands in a **data lake** (unstructured-tolerant).  
- Moves to a **data warehouse** (structured, query-optimised) after processing.  
- Cleaned data uses **columnar, partitioned formats** (by date/source).  

**Rationale**:  
Dual storage handles diversity—lake for raw flexibility (e.g., reprocessing unstructured SMS), warehouse for fast queries (e.g., reporting). Columnar formats optimise performance, chosen for scalability, assuming growing volumes. Partitioning enhances efficiency, addressing high query loads for analytics teams.  

---

## 5. Serving & Access
**Design**:  
- A query layer supports aggregations (e.g., by category, region) for reporting teams (dashboards, KPIs), data scientists (predictive models), and operations (surge alerts).  
- Role-based views ensure metric consistency.  

**Rationale**:  
Structured querying eliminates manual spreadsheets, breaking silos. Tailored access (near-real-time for operations, stable for reports) meets varied needs, chosen to deliver timely insights and support advanced analytics (e.g., churn prediction), directly addressing management’s need for actionable data.  

---

## 6. Orchestration & Monitoring
**Design**:  
- Hybrid scheduling: micro-batches (15–60 minutes) for social/SMS, daily batches for logs/forms.  
- Monitor pipeline health (e.g., latency, failures), data quality (e.g., freshness, anomalies), and business signals (e.g., complaint surges).  
- Automated alerts and retries.  

**Rationale**:  
Flexible schedules align with source dynamics, balancing freshness and resource use to prevent delays. Comprehensive monitoring ensures reliability, addressing potential failures in siloed data flows, with alerts enabling rapid response.  

---

## 7. DataOps & Production Readiness
**Practices**:  
- Environment separation (dev → test → prod).  
- Versioning and change management for schemas and taxonomy.  
- Automated checks and validation before/after deployments.  
- Security/privacy: PII minimisation, masking in non-prod, least-privilege access, retention aligned to regulation.  
- Cost and scalability planning for complaint surges.  

**Rationale**:  
Scalable deployment handles volume spikes, chosen assuming telecom growth. Staging and versioning ensure stability, while privacy controls address regulatory unknowns (e.g., SMS data), ensuring production reliability and compliance.  

---

## Challenges & Unknowns
**Challenges**:  
- Linking anonymous social data to customers.  
- Ensuring privacy compliance.  
- Managing surge-driven latency.  
- Calibrating sentiment/urgency with CX teams.  

**Unknowns**:  
- Exact volumes per channel.  
- Specific regulations.  
- Taxonomy evolution.  

**Mitigation**:  
- Modular design for iterative updates.  
- Rule-based taxonomy for flexibility.  
- Scalable storage/processing for surges.

## Conclusion
This blueprint automates complaint data flows, enabling insights like network issue trends or churn risks, reducing delays, and unifying teams. Implementation phases will start with ingestion/standardisation, then expand to enrichment and analytics.
